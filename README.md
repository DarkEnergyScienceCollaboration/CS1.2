#  Document measurement definitions

Summary -- Create a document containing the definitions of all important galaxy parameters. This document
should also contain mappings from noiseless catalog parameters to noisy mea- sured values where reasonable to
do so.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS1.2.1 ( 09/16 ): Research measurement methods for the galaxy properties delivered in 
[CS1.1](www.github.com/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/CS1.1) to
determine the optimal measurement technique for each one.
* Key Task CS1.2.2 ( 09/16 ): Produce a library to execute the necessary measurements so that there is a
reference implementation for the project.
* Key Task CS1.2.3 ( 09/16 ): Produce a formal document hosted in a version control system (github) that
describes the measurement techniques and outlines the relevant decision making points.


### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
